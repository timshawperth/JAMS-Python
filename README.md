# JAMS-Python
## JAMS Python scripts

Growing (hopefully) library to encapsulate REST calls into JAMS.

### Pre-Requsite
you'll need the python requests library from here; https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/

Set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to point to this directory (when you've cloned the repo).

### Info
Update testjams.py to add a host,username and password (couldn't be fussed making them cmdline params).

MVP at the moment;

* Load a Job
* Update a Job
* Add a Schedule to a Job
* Add a Resource to a Job
