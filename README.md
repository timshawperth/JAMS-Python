# JAMS-Python
## JAMS Python scripts

Growing (hopefully) library to encapsulate REST calls into JAMS.

Set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to point to this directory (when you've cloned the repo).

Update testjams.py to add a host,username and password (couldn't be fussed making them cmdline params).
